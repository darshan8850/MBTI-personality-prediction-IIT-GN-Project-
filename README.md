This project aims to use machine learning techniques to predict an individual's Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality type based on their responses to a set of questions or other input data. The model is trained and evaluated using a Kaggle dataset of MBTI responses.


## Dependencies
  * Python 3.x
  * pandas
  * scikit-learn
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * seaborn
  * nltk
  * sklearn
  * Any other library as per requirement

## Data
  The data used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/mbti-type) and contains a total of 8600 records, each with the individual's responses to the MBTI assessment questions, as       well as the corresponding personality type.

## Model
  The model used in this project is based on a machine learning algorithm such as Random Forest Classifier, SVM, Neural Network, or any other algorithm that suits the problem.Out of which XG Boost out performs all of them.
  
## Evaluation
 The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
